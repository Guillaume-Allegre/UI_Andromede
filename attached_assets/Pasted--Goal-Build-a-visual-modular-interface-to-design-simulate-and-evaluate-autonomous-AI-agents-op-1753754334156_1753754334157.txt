üß≠ Goal:
Build a visual, modular interface to design, simulate, and evaluate autonomous AI agents operating inside enterprise-grade workflows. Think ‚ÄúFigma meets Unity for AI agents.‚Äù

üéØ Core Purpose
Enable AI teams and domain experts to:

Design complex agent workflows using drag-and-drop primitives.

Simulate real-world enterprise scenarios (sales, HR, support).

Train agents through interaction with simulated tools and humans.

Evaluate performance using defined reward metrics ‚Äî all within a closed loop.

üìê Design Principles
Modularity: Every scenario is composed of reusable components: actors, tools, triggers, rewards, and orchestrators.

Visual-first: Intuitive flowchart-style canvas to define agent-environment interactions without code.

No-code/low-code extensibility: Technical users can inject logic; non-technical users can build from templates.

Realism-first: The UI must support complex enterprise workflows ‚Äî including permissions, delays, parallel interactions, and conditional logic.

üß© Main Components to Build
1. Environment Workspace
Project navigator (e.g., "Helix") with folders like:

Scenarios: end-to-end business processes

Tools: APIs and interfaces (e.g., Salesforce, Gmail)

Runs: simulation history

Dashboard: analytics, performance, outcomes

2. Scenario Builder Canvas
Node-based editor with:

Actors: Human, Agent, Orchestrator

Tools: External systems (Calendar, CRM, DB)

Triggers: Events that start agent actions

Rewards: Success conditions (e.g., meeting booked)

Connections (edges) define data flow or control logic

3. Agent Manager
Configure agent backends (e.g., OpenAI, custom LLM)

Define memory, tools access, permissions

Run evaluations, analyze performance

Simulate behavior with real-world inputs

4. Simulation & Feedback
Trigger and observe simulated runs

Collect data: conversation logs, success metrics, trace graphs

Replay & debug agent behavior

Export results for RL training or benchmarking

üì¶ Core Entities
Entity	Description
Actor	Can be AI (agent), human (customer), or orchestrator
Tool	API, interface, or environment service the agent uses
Trigger	Events that launch interactions (time, action, signal)
Reward	Task outcome metrics to train/evaluate the agent
Scenario	Composition of actors/tools/rewards that define a ta
